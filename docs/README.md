## Hosting

These pages are hosted using [netlifycms](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and get
automatically updated on every push to the `master` branch.

## Install

These pages use the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.
If you are planning to contribute you'll want to download and install Hugo on
your local machine.

The installation of Hugo is out of the scope of this document, so please take
the [official install instructions](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) to
get Hugo up and running.

## Development

To generate the website and serve it on [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)
just execute this command and stop it with `Ctrl+C`:

```
make server
```

When you are done with your changes just create a pull request, after merging
the pull request the website will be updated automatically.
