# Support Options

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/Gitea)
- [Discourse Forum](https://discourse.gitea.io/)

**NOTE:** When asking for support, it may be a good idea to have the following available so that the person helping has all the info they need:

1. Your `app.ini` (with any sensitive data scrubbed as necessary)
2. The `gitea.log` (and any other appropriate log files for the situation)
  * e.g. If the error is related to the database, the `xorm.log` might be helpful
3. Any error messages you are seeing
4. When possible, try to replicate the issue on [try.gitea.io](https://try.gitea.io) and include steps so that others can reproduce the issue.
  * This will greatly improve the chance that the root of the issue can be quickly discovered and resolved.
