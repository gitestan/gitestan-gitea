# What is Gitea?

Gitea is a painless self-hosted Git service. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.
Gitea is a fork of [Gogs](http://gogs.io). See the [Gitea Announcement](https://blog.gitea.io/2016/12/welcome-to-gitea/)
blog post to read about the justification for a fork.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting
up a self-hosted Git service. With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution
across all platforms and architectures that Go supports. This support includes Linux, macOS, and
Windows, on architectures like amd64, i386, ARM, PowerPC, and others.

## System Requirements

- A Raspberry Pi 3 is powerful enough to run Gitea for small workloads.
- 2 CPU cores and 1GB RAM is typically sufficient for small teams/projects.
- Gitea should be run with a dedicated non-root system account on UNIX-type systems.
   - Note: Gitea manages the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. Running Gitea as a regular user could break that user's ability to log in.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 1.7.2 or later is required. Version 1.9.0 or later is recommended. Also please note:
   - Git [large file storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) will be available if enabled when git >= 2.1.2.
   - Git commit-graph rendering will be enabled automatically when git >= 2.18.

## Browser Support

- Please see [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI#browser-support) for specific versions of supported browsers.
